# Track_Data_Scraper

This program is intended to scrape data from a user's custom lists of athletes on NCSA.com. It will get athlete's name, number, and address and store that information in a spreadsheet.

## Installation

Installation instructions go here. 

## Tutorial

- After launching the program input your email and password in the appropriate text boxes.
- In the lists text box input what lists you would like to loop over. The only filtering of inputted lists that takes place is leading and trailing spaces are removed, so it is important you enter the lists names EXACTLY as shown on the website. If the name is not exact, the list will not be scraped. Lists should be formatted as described on the application: My Cool List, My Cooler List, My Coolest List, etc.
  - If you would like to loop through all lists then leave this input blank.
- After all your inoformation is inputted, check that it is correct.
  - The password field is blocked by default. It can be shown by clicking the button of the right of the input.
  - It is highly reccomended that you check this BEFORE clicking submit. The application is quite crude and can take a long time to realize your mistake (if at all). - Once you are sure your information is correct, click submit and wait from 2-30 minutes (depending on your internet speed).
  - A loading icon will appear while the program is working. DO NOT SHUT OFF YOUR COMPUTER. 
- When the program is done scraping you will recieve a status message of success or failure
  - The spreadsheet with athlete information can be found in your donwloads folder

## Troubleshooting

If the program fails there are a few things that can be done to troubleshoot.
- Restart the program or your computer and run it again
- Check the slow internet box and run the program again
- Double check that your inputs are correct (list names are a common mistake)
- Ensure that NSCA.com is accessible in your web browser
- Wait for some time and try running the program again (a few hours)
- Call Ethan and tell him his program sucks
